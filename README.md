# LittleLemonAPI

In this Meta Back-End Developer API project, i created a fully functioning API project for the Little Lemon restaurant so that the client application developers can use the APIs to develop web and mobile applications. People with different roles will be able to browse, add and edit menu items, place orders, browse orders, assign delivery crew to orders and finally deliver the orders. 
These API end pints allowed customers to browse food items, view the item of the day and place orders. Managers were able to update the item of the day and monitor orders and assign deliveries. And the delivery crew should be able to check the orders assigned to them and update an order once itâ€™s delivered.
